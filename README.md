# Doubly-Linked-List-Generic
An implementation of a generic doubly linked list, inmplemented with a class template in CPP.
each node has an integer key and generic data.

**The list supports the following:**

-insertion to the start or the end of the list. O(1).

-insertion after and before a specific node of the list.O(1) when the node is given.

-ordered insertion - assuming the list is sorted. O(n).

-iteration and reverse iteration over the list. O(n).

-finding and returning the node of a specific key. O(n).

-deleting a node in the list. O(1) when the node is given.

-deleting the node of a specific key. O(n).

-printing the list. O(n).

-getting the list's head or tail. O(1).

-getting the list's size. O(1)
